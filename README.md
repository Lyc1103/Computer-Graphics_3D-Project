# Description

In this project, I am going to parctice creating a nice-looking scene which includes multiple 3D objects.

<div id = "user requirement">

# Required User Interaction:

- One of the 3D objects is the <b>"player"</b>. Users can move the player and rotate the player by the mouse and keyboard.
- By default, your camera should move/rotate along with the <b>"player"</b>. This is so called the first person view angle.
- Allow users to switch between the first person view angle and the third person view angle ( by pressing the mouse button or a key ). The third person view angle can be just a fixed camera position which can cover most of the region of your scene.

<div id = "technical requirement">

# Technical Requirements:

- 1 point light and implement the local illumination <b>( ambient + difusse + specular and phong shading )</b>
- At least, 1 of the 3D objects with nice texture mapping
- Use an environment cube map to have the environment background
- Make some of your objects keep moving or rotating. This is an example, http://math.hws.edu/graphicsbook/source/webgl/cube-camera.html
- At the bottom of your webpage, write some texts to shortly introduce your work and tell users how to play your work

<div id = "options">
<br>
<br>

# Options:

- shadow
- cube map reflection/refraction
- dynamic reflection
- bump mapping

### P.S.

If you want to run my project, please move all the files in `Obj_Bag` and `Pictures_Bag` these two folders to the same level as the file `WebGL.js` first.
